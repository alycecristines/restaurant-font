# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Necessary tools for run the app

- [x] Node.js - In case you needed you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [x] Yarn - In case you wanna use yarn intead of npm you can just add it by running `npm install -g yarn` on your console

## Instaling dependencies for the project

After you have node installed you need to execute `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies necessary for running the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
